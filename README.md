VTOL stands for "vertical take-off and landing" and refers to aircraft that can take off and land vertically. Rotorcraft, such as helicopters, use lift generated by rotating blades to achieve vertical flight, while powered-lift planes, such as the Harrier and V-22 Osprey, use a combination of vertical lift and conventional fixed wing design to achieve vertical take-off and landing. VTOL technology allows aircraft to take off and land almost anywhere and perform manoeuvres not possible with a conventional plane. Some companies, such as Uber and Lilium, are working on developing VTOL systems for use in flying taxis. Airbus has also developed a prototype hybrid car that can fly using VTOL technology, and NASA has created the battery-powered GL-10, which can take off and land vertically but flies like a conventional plane. VTOL drones are aircraft that are capable of vertical take-off and landing. They are often equipped with multiple rotors or propellers to provide lift, allowing them to hover and maneuverer in the air with great precision. VTOL drones are used for a variety of applications, including aerial photography, surveying, search and rescue, and delivery of goods. They offer many advantages over traditional aircraft, including the ability to operate in urban or confined spaces, as well as the ability to take off and land vertically, which eliminates the need for a runway. VTOL drones are also typically more energy efficient than their fixed-wing counterparts, as they do not need  to generate lift through forward motion. However, VTOL drones can be more complex to design and operate and may be more expensive than traditional aircraft. Despite these challenges, VTOL drone technology is quickly advancing, and it is expected to play a significant role in the future of aviation. Recent developments have taken place to make the concept of VTOL drone more industry relevant and modular which can be used for various such applications. One such development is the use of various kinds of wings to ascertain the most fitting wing model would provide most efficient characteristics

PROBLEM STATEMENT

The commercial drones that are operational today are available for a multitude of segments, thus we do not see variations or optimizations made to the wing. Particularly for a VTOL type configuration of drone. We try to create a new wing configuration for the VTOL based on the most suitable design considerations from the research work that has been performed over the time.
